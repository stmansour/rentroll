How To Use DBGEN
----------------

dbgen is a program used to create a rentroll database with predictable or
random information.  It can be used to generate a database with any number
of rentables, rentable types, rental agreements, and transactants. It adds
payment information as well with some controls to randomize payments.  Some 
fields are required and some are optional.

dbgen is driven by a configuration file. Several examples are provided with
the source code.

dbgen always dumps DtStart/DtStop and the RSeed value to stdout each time it is
run. The date values are there to remind you of the time period to look for the
data.  The RSeed value is there in case you want to reproduce exactly the same
database.


Attribute Definitions
---------------------
Carports  (optional)
    The count of the number of Carports to create as rentables. Default is 0.

CPMarketRate  (optional)
    The market rate rent amount for carports.

CPRentCycle  (optional)
    The frequency at which rent is assessed for rentables of this type.

CPProrateCycle  (optional)
    The proration cycle for rent on rentables of this type.

DtStart  (required)
    This is a date value used for the starting date of just about every
    time period.  This includes Rental Agreements and Assessments.

DtStop  (required)
    This is a date value used as the stopping date for periods. It is the
    counterpart of DtStart.

RT  (required)
    This is an array of RentableType structures.

RT.Count  (required)
    The number of Rentables of this type to create

RT.MarketRate  (required)
    The market rate rent amount for rentables of this RentableType. This
    value is used for the rent assessments.

RT.RentCycle  (required)
    The frequency at which rent is assessed for rentables of this type. Recur
    frequency values are the same for all recurring values. The specific
    values are:

        SECONDLY  = 1
        MINUTELY  = 2
        HOURLY    = 3
        DAILY     = 4
        WEEKLY    = 5
        MONTHLY   = 6
        QUARTERLY = 7
        YEARLY    = 8

RT.ProrateCycle  (required)
    The frequency at which proration is calculated if a rentable is only
    rented for a portion of the RT.RentCycle.

RT.Style  (optional)
    The short name designation to associate with the RentableType. If it is
    not specified, it will have a default value of "ST000" where 000 is a 
    monotonically increasing number for each RentableType.

RT.Name  (optional)
    The name of this RentableType. If not specified, the default value is of
    the form "RType000" where 000 is a monotonically increasing number for
    each RentableType.

OpDepositoryName  (required)
    Name of the bank (depository) used for operational finances.

SecDepDepositoryName  (required)
    Name of the bank (depository) used for operational finances.

PTypeCheckName  (required)
    Name of PaymentType used for checks.  Typically, "check".

PeopleCount  (required)
	Number of Transactants created. If this value is less than the number of
	RentalAgreements requested (RACount) then some transactants will be the 
	payor on more than one RentalAgreement.

PetFees [] (optional)
    PetFees is a BusinessProperty. It is an array of strings. The strings 
    are the names of Account Rules which should be applied to pets.

RACount  (required)
    Number of rental agreements to create. If this count is greater than the
    number of all the rentables created then the program will stop creating
    rental agreements once it has used all the rentables.

RSeed  (optional)
    Number used to seed the random number generator. If not specified, the 
    seed will be a highly random number based on the current system time. If 
    it is specified then the databases it creates will be predictable. 
    Otherwise, they will be highly random.

RandName  (optional)
    Set to false if not present. If set to true, the transactant names will be 
    randomly chosen from a large list of first and last names.  Note, phone 
    numbers, email addresses, and land addresses are always totally random.

RandomizePayments  (optional)
    Set to false if not present. If set to true, the code will inhibit the
    creation of a percentage of payments from payors. The percentage is 
    controlled by RandMissPayment, see below.  Also, the code will not apply 
    some percentage of payments made. The percentage is controlled by 
    RandMissApply, see below.  This can be helpful to check the functioning of
    the Rentroll view, the RentRoll report, payor statements, and rental 
    agreement statements.

RandMissPayment  (optional)
    Specifies the percent (0-99) of payments that will be randomly skipped. The
    default value is 0.

RandMissApply  (optional)
    Specifies the percent (0-99) of payments that will not be applied. The 
    default value is 0.

VehicleFees [] (optional)
    VehiclesFees is a BusinessProperty. It is an array of strings. The strings
    are the names of Account Rules which should be applied to vehicles.


Example Configuration File
--------------------------

This is the contents of db25.json.  It does not make use of every attribute,
but it is a representative example of how to generate a useful database
containing 25 Rentables, 30 Transactants, and 23 Rental Agreements.
